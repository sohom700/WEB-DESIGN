            <P>A Mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant
                exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited
                summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (980 ft) above the
                surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.Mountains are
                formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of
                millions of years.</P>
